Library Management System(LMS) is a console-based project used for library. which perform CRUD Operation with books like add the book their author and price and update book details and delete books which are not required
.For this project  MVC Architecture pattern has been used which helps to organise the code.For LMS you use java language.
>MVC Architecture(Model View Controller)

>1.Model:

1:In model we will be storing entities

2: data logic will be provided through getters and setters.

Enter name of library : Qspiders Library

Enter address of library:Mumbai

Enter pincode:353567

>Installation:

.make sure your JDK is successfully installed because in java we used Eclipse for writting the program and Eclipse is dependent on JDK 

.During installation of Eclipse make sure to download based on your device

.After download store the Eclipse in a directory


.After installation of Eclipse create folders and set  workspaces 

.Create java file>New>java project>project name.
